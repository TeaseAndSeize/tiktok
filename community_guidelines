We encourage you to keep reading.Content ModerationWe want TikTok to be a safe, fun, and creative place for everyone. Here's how we support that goal:We Remove ContentEveryone on TikTok can share content, but when we identify content that falls under the "Not Allowed" rules in our Community Guidelines, we'll remove it.We Age-Restrict ContentSome content may not be appropriate for people under 18. When we identify content that falls under the "Age-Restricted" standards in our Community Guidelines, we make it viewable only for adults.For You Feed StandardsThe For You Feed is designed to help you discover a variety of content and creators, and for creators to reach new audiences and build thriving communities. However, not all content is guaranteed to be recommended. When we identify content that falls under the "FYF Ineligible" standards in our Community Guidelines, it won't be recommended in the FYF. You can read more about what qualifies here.We Give You Tools and Resources to Stay Informed and in ControlYou are empowered to manage your experience on TikTok. We provide a safety toolkit that helps you customise your content preferences and account settings, and manage interactions.

They're all about keeping you safe, respecting human rights, and supporting a creative and welcoming community. We developed these principles with the foundational goal of preventing harm and enabling expression.At times, we have to make difficult tradeoffs between competing goals. When that happens, we approach the decision thoughtfully and rely on trusted guidance, including:Internationally recognised global human rights standardsFeedback from our community and Advisory CouncilsInput from experts in online safety, public health, and related fieldsHere are the eight principles:Prevent Harm: Keeping TikTok safe and fun is our top priority. Harm can look different—it might be physical, emotional, or even financial. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimise the impact on speech.Support Free Expression: TikTok thrives on creativity. We honour this principle by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform, while also proactively addressing behaviour that can inhibit the speech of others. However, free expression isn't an absolute right. It's always considered in proportion to the potential harm, and can result in your content being removed or not recommended in the FYF.Encourage Kindness and Respect: We aim to foster a space where people treat each other with empathy and dignity. Our approach is designed to help prevent content that demeans or dehumanises others, making TikTok a safer and more welcoming place for everyone.Respect Local Cultures: People use TikTok in over 150 countries. We work with local experts to make sure that our global approach considers the way harms are experienced across regions, and that we allow for regional applications of our guidelines while upholding human rights standards.Champion Inclusion: We celebrate the diverse cultures and experiences that make up our TikTok community. We also recognise that some communities have historically faced barriers to participation and expression, and we're committed to reducing disproportionate harms.Protect Privacy: We are committed to protecting the privacy of our community and anyone shown or discussed on the platform. We strive to ensure that content doesn't expose anyone's personal information or invade their intimate privacy.Be Transparent and Consistent: We want everyone to know what our rules and standards are, and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently, and to share our enforcement efforts at our Transparency Centre.Act Fairly: Evaluating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, but we're committed to being impartial, clear, and providing opportunities to appeal.In rare and exceptional situations—such as crises or moments of social unrest—we may adjust our usual enforcement or rules to protect our community and address emerging harms, while remaining guided by our principles.Was it helpful?YesNoNext article Youth Safety and Well-BeingRead nextYouth Safety and Well-BeingReleased 14 August 2025Effective 13 September 2025We're committed to making TikTok a safe and positive experience for everyone, especially for people under 18. This is who we mean when we refer to "youth" or "young people" in these Community Guidelines. To help keep the platform safer for this age group, we:Set age limits for certain features (like needing to be 16+ for your videos to appear in the FYF, or to use Direct Messages)Use more restrictive privacy settings by default for younger usersLimit content that may not be appropriate for people under 18, with content filters and other safeguards. Learn more about this kind of content in the "Age-Restricted" sections throughout these Community Guidelines.Age Restrictions and Safety FeaturesYou need to be at least 13 years old to create a TikTok account. In some countries, the minimum age may be different based on local laws. In the United States, there is a separate under-13 TikTok experience that includes extra protections like:Restricting interactive features that enable users to directly engage with others, such as commenting on content, messaging, sharing their videos, or maintaining an online profileFYF with content that's age-appropriate, as assessed by Common Sense NetworksA dedicated Privacy PolicyIf you create a new account in the United States and are under 13, you will automatically enter into this experience.We remove accounts when we believe the user is under the minimum age required to have one. If we believe someone isn't old enough for features with a minimum age requirement, we'll restrict their access to those features. If your account was removed and you think it was a mistake, you can file an appeal. Anyone can report an account they believe belongs to someone who's too young to have an account—either in the app or online.We know that parents sometimes post content featuring their children. If you do so, it needs to be clear that the account belongs to an adult. The bio, profile picture, or username are good places to do this.Youth Safety EnforcementWe don't allow content that could harm young people—physically, emotionally, or developmentally. If we become aware an account holder has committed a sexual offence against a young person, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to that person. We report incidents of youth sexual abuse and exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.Learn more at our Teen Safety Centre and Guardian's Guide.Was it helpful?YesNoNext article Safety and CivilityRead nextSafety and CivilityReleased 14 August 2025Effective 13 September 2025Feeling safe and respected is important for everyone's well-being, and treating each other with kindness and civility helps communities thrive.

To respect local norms, we may apply these guidelines differently depending on the region.Body Exposure and Sexualised BehavioursTikTok is a place to celebrate who you are—your identity, your body, and your culture. It's also a space where you can learn and have conversations about topics like sexuality and reproductive health. At the same time, we want to protect young people and respect diverse cultural norms. That's why we don't allow certain types of body exposure or sexualised behaviour, including:Nudity or sexual activitySexual ServicesSexually suggestive acts or significant body exposure involving youthWhile we generally don't allow adult nudity or sexual activity, we make limited exceptions for documentaries, sex education, fiction, and art.

In some situations—such as when there's an elevated risk of harm to users or communities—we may limit visibility of certain search results.In addition, some content that's allowed on TikTok may not be suitable for all audiences, and might not appear as a top result.Search results and recommendations may look different for everyone. That's because we consider things like your past searches and what you've watched to help make results more relevant. We also try to highlight content from reliable sources at the top.We recommend searches across TikTok to support discovery, learning, and exploration. To help ensure the experience remains safe and enjoyable, we prioritise entertaining and informative content in search recommendations, and don't recommend terms associated with harassment, sensationalism, or graphic and disturbing themes. If you see a search recommendation that you believe violates our Community Guidelines, report it to us here.External LinksCreators often share links in their bios, profiles, or videos to help you find more content. While many of these links are useful or informative, some lead to harmful content that isn't allowed on TikTok. If a link breaks our rules, we'll remove it. We may also temporarily stop you from posting links—or, for severe violations, ban your account.CommentsComments let you connect with others, which is a big part of TikTok. If a comment breaks our rules, we'll remove it. If someone keeps breaking the rules, we may limit or remove their ability to comment; in more severe cases, we may ban their account.Comments are sorted based on multiple aspects, including your past replies, likes, and reports. This helps keep the comment section relevant and engaging, and it may look different from one person to the next. Comments may be sorted lower if they don't add to the conversation, like:Spam: Random text, irrelevant promotions, or linksProfanity that's non-neutral or targets othersOffensive Statements: Aggressive or provocative remarks about someoneLearn more about the tools you can use to control the comments on your own videos, and how to report a comment here.Direct MessagesDirect messages (DMs) let you share videos and chat with one or more people.

Content first goes through an automated review process. If content is identified as a potential violation, it will be automatically removed, or flagged for additional review by our moderators. Additional review will occur if content gains popularity or has been reported. To support moderation accuracy, we apply additional quality assurance processes to some accounts that have already gone through additional validation processes, such as verified accounts.Even with our robust moderation measures and processes, we can't guarantee that all content complies with our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. If you see something that seems to break the rules, you can report it in the app or on our website.Learn more about our enforcement efforts through our Transparency Centre.Notice and AppealsWe believe in fairness and consistency. If your content breaks a rule, we seek to explain to you why it was removed. If your account is banned, you'll see a message in the app. If your content is made ineligible for the FYF or otherwise restricted, this information will appear in the TikTok analytics tool.If your account was banned, or your content was removed, made ineligible for the FYF, or otherwise restricted, and you believe this was an error, you may appeal the decision. Once your appeal is filed, you can view its status in the in-app Safety Centre, as well as the status of any reports you have filed about other content or accounts.Was it helpful?YesNo
